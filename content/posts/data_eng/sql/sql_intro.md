## 1. SQL
SQL stands for structured query language. It is a language to interact with *databases*.
*Database* is an organized collection of structured information, or data, typically stored electronically in a computer system.
Database consists of schemas, which are a collection of tables and help structuring the database.
Database is managed by Database Management Systems(DBMS). One example of DMBS is PostgreSQL.

### a) Dialects of SQL
All DMBS's have slightly different dialects even though the differences are small. Among all DMBS's, PostgreSQL is a good place to start because

- PostgreSQL is  closest to the standard SQL.
- Free to download and use.
- The most popular and advanced open-source DMBS due to its extensive feature set, strong performance, and scalability. It offers a wide range of advanced features like support for both relational and non-relational data types (JSON, XML, etc.), robust concurrency control, and powerful extensions for geospatial data, full-text search, and more.
