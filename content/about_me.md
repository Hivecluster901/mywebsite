Hi there! I'm currently in the third year of my DPhil (PhD) in Quantum Computing at the University of Oxford. Over the past few years, I've spent a lot of time writing Python code — from simulating quantum dots to building machine learning models for quantum devices. Through it all, I’ve realized how much I enjoy working with data and building software that actually *works*.

I’m now shifting gears toward the world of **data engineering** and **data science**, where I hope to keep solving real problems with code, just in a different context.

Outside of tech, you’ll probably find me in the kitchen experimenting with new recipes, playing the piano (mostly classical), or trying to hit a new PR at the gym. I’m always up for a challenge — whether it’s debugging a pipeline or learning a new Chopin piece!
