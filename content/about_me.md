Hi there! I’m currently in the third year of my DPhil (PhD) in Quantum Computing at the University of Oxford. My research journey began with practical work on quantum hardware, including coding simulations of quantum dots and developing machine learning models for quantum devices. Recently, I’ve been shifting my focus towards quantum algorithms, as well as strategies for error mitigation and error correction.

Outside of tech, you’ll probably find me in the kitchen experimenting with new recipes, playing the piano (mostly classical), or trying to hit a new PR at the gym. I’m always up for a challenge — whether it’s debugging a pipeline or learning a new Chopin piece!
